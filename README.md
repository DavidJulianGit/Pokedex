# Pokédex App

Welcome to the Pokédex App! This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey, where I aimed to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Below, you will find details about the project, its features, and instructions on how to set it up and run it.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to build a small web application that loads data from an external API and displays it in an easy-to-navigate and detailed manner.

## Features

-  **Data Loading**: The app loads data from the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/9).
-  **Item List**: Displays a list of Pokémon
-  **Detailed View**: Provides detailed information about a selected Pokémon via a modal.
-  **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for Pokémon by name.
-  **Sortability**: The list is sortable by Pokémon name or by it's index in the original Pokédex from the video game.
-  **Responsive UI**: Ensures a user-friendly experience across different devices and screen sizes.
-  **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages if data cannot be loaded.

## Technology

-  **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Bootswatch**: For structuring and styling the web app.
-  **JavaScript**: Core functionality of the app including API interactions and UI updates.
-  **ESLint**: Code is formatted according to ESLint rules for consistent and error-free code.
-  **UI Pattern**: Uses a modal for detailed views of each Pokémon.
